## STAGE 3: MEETING THE MENTOR

Discovering guidance that shows you the difference between authentic service and achievement-driven helping. Learning that true help doesn't need applause, and genuine care doesn't require being the best helper in the room.

## STAGE 4: CROSSING THE THRESHOLD

Taking the first steps toward helping without needing recognition, serving without competing, and supporting others without measuring your success against other helpers.

## STAGE 5: TESTS AND TRIALS

Facing situations where you must choose between getting credit for helping and simply serving. Learning to support others' success without needing to be seen as the reason for their achievements.

Developing the courage to help quietly, to let others receive recognition for their growth, and to find fulfillment in service that may never be acknowledged or celebrated.

Experiencing the deep satisfaction of genuine service - helping without strings attached, supporting without competing, caring without performing. Discovering that authentic help feels infinitely more fulfilling than admired help.

## STAGE 11: RETURN WITH THE ELIXIR

## BRAIN-HEART DISCONNECT
