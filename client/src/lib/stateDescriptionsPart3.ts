    veryGood: {
      name: "Very Good State",
      description: "I feel fully alive, brimming with joy, gratitude, and clarity. I savor each moment and appreciate life's richness, not by chasing distractions, but by being deeply present. I radiate optimism and inspire others with my contagious energy. I use my enthusiasm to uplift, not escape. I'm committed to what matters most and can sit with discomfort without needing to run from it. Freedom isn't about escaping pain, it's about embracing life fully, with open arms."
    },
    good: {
      name: "Good State",
      description: "I'm upbeat, adventurous, and full of creative ideas. I love exploring new possibilities and finding joy in the small things. I'm the one who brings lightness to heavy situations and excitement to the everyday. I stay busy and like having lots of options, it keeps life fun and engaging. I'm spontaneous, playful, and can always find the silver lining. I want to live life to the fullest and help others do the same."
    },
    average: {
      name: "Average State",
      description: "I avoid boredom at all costs. I jump from idea to idea, person to person, craving stimulation and fearing commitment. I distract myself from uncomfortable feelings with plans, fantasies, or overindulgence. I try to stay positive, but it's often a mask. I struggle to focus and finish what I start. I chase freedom but feel restless. Deep down, I'm afraid that if I slow down, I'll have to face things I've been running from."
    },
    belowAverage: {
      name: "Below Average State",
      description: "I become scattered, impulsive, and emotionally avoidant. I overcommit, overpromise, and feel overwhelmed. I numb myself with excess, food, entertainment, talking, shopping, anything to escape discomfort. I feel trapped by my own desire to stay free. I avoid difficult conversations and push people away when they get too close. I pretend everything's okay, but inside I feel panicked and lost. I fear being bored, abandoned, or stuck, so I keep running."
    },
    destructive: {
      name: "Destructive State",
      description: "I spiral into compulsive escapism. I'm reckless, self-centered, and incapable of sitting still. I burn bridges, abandon responsibilities, and hurt those I love, not out of cruelty, but out of desperation. I run from every emotion, numbing myself with thrills or addictions. I chase highs but feel increasingly empty. I avoid all forms of pain, reflection, or accountability. My life becomes a blur of distraction, chaos, and denial, with no clear sense of purpose or direction."
    }
  },
  "8": {
    veryGood: {
      name: "Very Good State",
      description: "I am a grounded, powerful protector. My strength flows from inner peace, not control. I lead with courage, compassion, and fairness, standing up for what's right, not just what's mine. I channel my intensity into building others up, not tearing them down. I have nothing to prove, so I can be open, generous, and kind. I am a fierce force for good, resilient, wise, and deeply loyal to those I care about."
    },
    good: {
      name: "Good State",
      description: "I'm confident, assertive, and direct. I say what others are afraid to say. I step up when things get tough and defend those who need it. I trust my instincts and take charge when needed. I don't shy away from confrontation, I see it as a way to clear the air. I value loyalty and honesty above all else. I respect strength in others and expect the same in return."
    },
    average: {
      name: "Average State",
      description: "I feel a constant need to stay in control. I push hard, speak bluntly, and take charge, even when it's not my place. I see the world as a place where only the strong survive. I trust very few people and question others' motives. I often see vulnerability as weakness, even in myself. I take pride in being tough, but sometimes I steamroll others without realizing it. I hate feeling powerless, so I make sure I never look weak."
    },
    belowAverage: {
      name: "Below Average State",
      description: "I become domineering, aggressive, and reactive. I control situations with force and pressure. I assume people are trying to take advantage of me, so I push back hard. I bulldoze through feelings, mine and others', to maintain control. I fear being betrayed, so I keep people at a distance or test their loyalty. I get stuck in cycles of anger, intimidation, and suspicion. I demand respect but don't always give it."
    },
    destructive: {
      name: "Destructive State",
      description: "I lose all sense of trust and become a tyrant in my own life. I lash out, blame, and destroy connections rather than risk being hurt. I seek revenge instead of resolution. I feel like the world is against me, so I go to war with it. I isolate myself behind walls of rage, pride, and fear. I can be explosive, paranoid, and cruel, all in a desperate attempt to avoid feeling vulnerable, weak, or out of control."
    }
  },
  "9": {
    veryGood: {
      name: "Very Good State",
      description: "I am deeply at peace with myself and the world. I radiate calm, wisdom, and quiet strength. I sense harmony even in chaos and can hold space for others without losing myself. I'm fully present, alert, and awake, no longer avoiding conflict, but embracing life with trust and openness. My presence soothes others. I create unity not by pleasing, but by truly understanding."
    },
    good: {
      name: "Good State",
      description: "I'm easygoing, patient, and calm. I avoid drama and try to keep the peace. I listen well and don't react quickly. I care about everyone getting along and will often put others' needs before my own to keep things smooth. I value comfort and stability. I try not to rock the boat and focus on what keeps life simple and pleasant."
    },
    average: {
      name: "Average State",
      description: "I stay quiet even when I have something important to say. I avoid conflict by giving in or tuning out. I procrastinate on decisions and hope problems go away on their own. I lose touch with my own desires and instead go along with others. I'm often tired, distracted, or mentally checked out. I focus on routine and comfort instead of growth or change."
    },
    belowAverage: {
      name: "Below Average State",
      description: "I become stubborn and passive-aggressive. I resist others not by arguing, but by withdrawing, stalling, or subtly sabotaging. I say \"yes\" to things I don't really want, then resent it later. I zone out with distractions and avoid anything uncomfortable. I shut down emotionally and pretend everything's fine when it's not. I feel invisible but fear what would happen if I truly spoke up."
    },
    destructive: {
      name: "Destructive State",
      description: "I completely lose my sense of self. I disconnect from reality, avoid responsibility, and let life happen to me instead of living it. I bury my anger, sadness, and needs so deeply that I no longer know who I am or what I want. I can become numb, apathetic, and unreachable, surviving in a fog. I may seem calm on the outside but feel empty and lost inside."
    }
