    veryGood: {
      name: "Very Good State",
      description: "I feel deeply connected, not only to myself, but to something greater. My emotions become art, and my life feels like a living poem. I express myself fully and truthfully, not for attention, but to inspire others to own their truth. I embrace both beauty and pain as sacred. I no longer feel separate, I belong, just as I am. I walk through the world with grace, depth, and authenticity, and people feel safe being real around me."
    },
    good: {
      name: "Good State",
      description: "I am emotionally aware and creatively alive. I see what others often miss, the subtle, the meaningful, the poetic. I'm sensitive, introspective, and value emotional honesty. I want to create things that are real and lasting. I don't mind being different, in fact, I treasure it. I'm drawn to what's deep, soulful, and expressive, and I connect most with people who are equally unafraid to show who they truly are."
    },
    average: {
      name: "Average State",
      description: "I often feel like something is missing. I long to be understood, but worry no one truly gets me. I compare myself to others, sometimes feeling inferior, other times secretly superior. I become moody or withdrawn, feeling like I don't belong anywhere. I crave connection, but I also want to protect my uniqueness. I romanticize the past or dream of a perfect future. I wear my emotions on my sleeve but struggle to stay grounded in the present."
    },
    belowAverage: {
      name: "Below Average State",
      description: "I start believing I'm broken. I dwell on my flaws, convinced I'll never be enough. I isolate myself, pushing people away while silently begging to be seen. I become dramatic or self-absorbed, using emotional intensity to feel alive. I might sabotage opportunities for love or success because I fear I don't deserve them. I want to be rescued, but also want to suffer alone so I can prove I survived. I lose sight of the beauty I once saw in myself."
    },
    destructive: {
      name: "Destructive State",
      description: "I sink into darkness and believe I'm defined by my pain. I romanticize suffering and wear it like armor. I push people away completely, believing they'll only abandon me anyway. I might hurt myself, emotionally or even physically, just to feel something. I become trapped in shame, addiction, or self-loathing. My identity collapses, and I no longer know who I am. If I don't find a lifeline, I risk disappearing into a spiral of despair, believing no one would miss me."
    }
  },
  "5": {
    veryGood: {
      name: "Very Good State",
      description: "My mind is expansive and clear, I see patterns, systems, and meaning where others see noise. I am both grounded and visionary. I can absorb vast knowledge while remaining emotionally present and connected to others. I use my insights to serve a purpose beyond myself. I trust the flow of life and no longer need to retreat to feel safe. My intellect is sharp, my boundaries healthy, and I feel energized, whole, and quietly powerful."
    },
    good: {
      name: "Good State",
      description: "I love to understand how things work. I'm naturally curious, observant, and enjoy deep thinking. I prefer meaningful conversations over small talk and often lose myself in learning, research, or ideas. I value privacy and independence, and I think before I speak. I like solving problems and finding clarity in complexity. When I feel safe, I enjoy sharing what I know and helping others gain insight too."
    },
    average: {
      name: "Average State",
      description: "I tend to withdraw when life feels too chaotic or overwhelming. I retreat into my mind or a private space where I can think freely. I avoid emotional demands or social pressure and prefer to stay in control of what I share. I can be aloof or emotionally detached, even if I care deeply. I worry about running out of energy or being intruded on, so I conserve my time and space. I'm often skeptical of people's motives, but I crave understanding and safety."
    },
    belowAverage: {
      name: "Below Average State",
      description: "I feel increasingly isolated, not just physically, but emotionally. I become suspicious, distant, and emotionally numb. I hide behind knowledge or routines as a way to avoid vulnerability. I don't trust easily and fear being overwhelmed by other people's needs. I become overly self-reliant, refusing to ask for help even when I need it. I may become cynical, avoidant, or overly critical, believing it's safer to stay detached than to risk connection."
    },
    destructive: {
      name: "Destructive State",
      description: "I shut down. I disconnect from my body, my feelings, and the world around me. I obsessively escape into information, fantasy, or addiction, anything to avoid the pain of being alive. I isolate completely and mistrust everyone. I become paranoid, emotionally frozen, and unable to function in daily life. I hoard energy, knowledge, or possessions to feel in control, but nothing soothes the internal emptiness. I believe no one can reach me, and sometimes, I want it that way."
    }
  },
  "6": {
    veryGood: {
      name: "Very Good State",
      description: "I am grounded in deep trust, both in myself and in life. My loyalty becomes a superpower, I am fiercely protective of what matters most while staying open to growth and change. I channel my natural vigilance into wisdom, able to assess situations clearly without falling into paranoia. I feel secure in uncertainty and can act with courage even when afraid. In this state, I am both strong and gentle, a reliable presence who helps others feel safe while staying true to my own inner compass."
    },
    good: {
      name: "Good State",
      description: "I am dependable, loyal, and thoughtful about potential problems or risks. I care deeply about security and safety, both for myself and those I love. I'm a natural troubleshooter who can spot what might go wrong before it happens. I value commitment, trust, and shared responsibility. I work well in teams and take my obligations seriously. I seek guidance when needed and offer steady support to others. I believe in being prepared and thinking ahead."
    },
    average: {
      name: "Average State",
      description: "I feel anxious much of the time, constantly scanning for potential threats or problems. I seek reassurance from others but struggle to trust my own judgment. I vacillate between blind faith and deep skepticism, depending on my stress level. I can be indecisive, second-guessing myself or looking for someone else to tell me what to do. I worry about making the wrong choice and often procrastinate on important decisions. I feel caught between wanting security and fearing commitment."
    },
    belowAverage: {
      name: "Below Average State",
      description: "I become either overly dependent on others or rigidly self-reliant, swinging between compliance and defiance. I question everyone's motives and find it hard to trust anyone completely. I become reactive, either anxiously seeking approval or defiantly pushing back against authority. I may become paralyzed by worst-case thinking or impulsively rebel against anything that feels controlling. I feel like I'm constantly under threat, even in safe situations."
    },
    destructive: {
      name: "Destructive State",
      description: "I am consumed by fear and suspicion. I see danger everywhere and trust no one, not even myself. I become either completely submissive to authority or violently rebellious against it. I may lash out at those trying to help me or cling desperately to anyone who offers false security. Paranoia, panic, and self-doubt dominate my thinking. I feel like I'm drowning in uncertainty, unable to find solid ground anywhere. In this state, I may harm relationships, sabotage opportunities, or even put myself in real danger through reckless or self-destructive behavior."
