    veryGood: {
      name: "Very Good State",
      description: "I feel deeply connected --- not only to myself, but to something greater. My emotions become art, and my life feels like a living poem. I express myself fully and truthfully, not for attention, but to inspire others to own their truth. I embrace both beauty and pain as sacred. I no longer feel separate --- I belong, just as I am. I walk through the world with grace, depth, and authenticity, and people feel safe being real around me."
    },
    good: {
      name: "Good State",
      description: "I am emotionally aware and creatively alive. I see what others often miss --- the subtle, the meaningful, the poetic. I'm sensitive, introspective, and value emotional honesty. I want to create things that are real and lasting. I don't mind being different --- in fact, I treasure it. I'm drawn to what's deep, soulful, and expressive, and I connect most with people who are equally unafraid to show who they truly are."
    },
    average: {
      name: "Average State",
      description: "I often feel like something is missing. I long to be understood, but worry no one truly gets me. I compare myself to others --- sometimes feeling inferior, other times secretly superior. I become moody or withdrawn, feeling like I don't belong anywhere. I crave connection, but I also want to protect my uniqueness. I romanticize the past or dream of a perfect future. I wear my emotions on my sleeve but struggle to stay grounded in the present."
    },
    belowAverage: {
      name: "Below Average State",
      description: "I start believing I'm broken. I dwell on my flaws, convinced I'll never be enough. I isolate myself, pushing people away while silently begging to be seen. I become dramatic or self-absorbed, using emotional intensity to feel alive. I might sabotage opportunities for love or success because I fear I don't deserve them. I want to be rescued --- but also want to suffer alone so I can prove I survived. I lose sight of the beauty I once saw in myself."
    },
    destructive: {
      name: "Destructive State",
      description: "I sink into darkness and believe I'm defined by my pain. I romanticize suffering and wear it like armor. I push people away completely, believing they'll only abandon me anyway. I might hurt myself --- emotionally or even physically --- just to feel something. I become trapped in shame, addiction, or self-loathing. My identity collapses, and I no longer know who I am. If I don't find a lifeline, I risk disappearing into a spiral of despair, believing no one would miss me."
    }
  },
  "5": {
    veryGood: {
      name: "Very Good State",
      description: "My mind is expansive and clear --- I see patterns, systems, and meaning where others see noise. I am both grounded and visionary. I can absorb vast knowledge while remaining emotionally present and connected to others. I use my insights to serve a purpose beyond myself. I trust the flow of life and no longer need to retreat to feel safe. My intellect is sharp, my boundaries healthy, and I feel energized, whole, and quietly powerful."
    },
    good: {
      name: "Good State",
      description: "I love to understand how things work. I'm naturally curious, observant, and enjoy deep thinking. I prefer meaningful conversations over small talk and often lose myself in learning, research, or ideas. I value privacy and independence, and I think before I speak. I like solving problems and finding clarity in complexity. When I feel safe, I enjoy sharing what I know and helping others gain insight too."
    },
    average: {
      name: "Average State",
      description: "I tend to withdraw when life feels too chaotic or overwhelming. I retreat into my mind or a private space where I can think freely. I avoid emotional demands or social pressure and prefer to stay in control of what I share. I can be aloof or emotionally detached, even if I care deeply. I worry about running out of energy or being intruded on, so I conserve my time and space. I'm often skeptical of people's motives, but I crave understanding and safety."
    },
    belowAverage: {
      name: "Below Average State",
      description: "I feel increasingly isolated --- not just physically, but emotionally. I become suspicious, distant, and emotionally numb. I hide behind knowledge or routines as a way to avoid vulnerability. I don't trust easily and fear being overwhelmed by other people's needs. I become overly self-reliant, refusing to ask for help even when I need it. I may become cynical, avoidant, or overly critical, believing it's safer to stay detached than to risk connection."
    },
    destructive: {
      name: "Destructive State",
      description: "I shut down. I disconnect from my body, my feelings, and the world around me. I obsessively escape into information, fantasy, or addiction --- anything to avoid the pain of being alive. I isolate completely and mistrust everyone. I become paranoid, emotionally frozen, and unable to function in daily life. I hoard energy, knowledge, or possessions to feel in control, but nothing soothes the internal emptiness. I believe no one can reach me --- and sometimes, I want it that way."
    }
  },
  "6": {
    veryGood: {
      name: "Very Good State",
      description: "I feel calm, grounded, and deeply supported --- both within myself and by life itself. I trust my instincts and blend logic with wisdom. I respond to uncertainty with steadiness, not fear. I'm loyal, principled, and able to lead others with quiet strength. When challenges arise, I face them with courage and resilience. I trust my inner voice and no longer second-guess everything. I feel safe --- not because the world is perfect, but because I know I can handle it."
    },
    good: {
      name: "Good State",
      description: "I'm dependable, thoughtful, and always thinking ahead. I like to be prepared and plan for any situation. I value loyalty, honesty, and strong relationships --- both personal and professional. I may worry sometimes, but I use that to keep things organized and running smoothly. I'm a steady, protective presence for those I care about. People rely on me because I'm consistent and trustworthy. I like knowing the rules and sticking to them, especially when they keep everyone safe."
    },
    average: {
      name: "Average State",
      description: "I often feel a low-level anxiety that doesn't go away. I overthink situations and doubt my decisions. I want to feel safe and certain, but I rarely do. I look to others for reassurance, but then second-guess their advice. I try to control what I can and stay alert for potential problems. I can be skeptical and question people's intentions, even when they've done nothing wrong. I'm torn between trusting my gut and fearing I'll make a mistake."
    },
    belowAverage: {
      name: "Below Average State",
      description: "I become increasingly reactive and suspicious. I assume the worst and act from fear. I struggle to trust anyone --- even those who care about me. I obsess over worst-case scenarios and worry myself into paralysis. I push people away, then feel alone and unsupported. I follow rules rigidly or rebel completely, depending on who I think I can trust. I struggle with authority --- needing it, resenting it, fearing it. I feel like the world is out to get me."
    },
    destructive: {
      name: "Destructive State",
      description: "I feel like I'm under attack mentally, emotionally, spiritually. My thoughts spiral out of control, and I'm consumed by fear. I see betrayal everywhere and trust no one, not even myself. I lash out or shut down. I may turn to rigid ideologies, conspiracy theories, or compulsive behaviours just to feel a sense of control. I become emotionally erratic, paranoid, panicked, or frozen. I'm trapped in a prison of my own mind, and everything feels unsafe, uncertain, and terrifying."
