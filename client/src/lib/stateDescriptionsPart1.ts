  "1": {
    veryGood: {
      name: "Very Good State",
      description: "In this state, I embody clarity, calm, and higher purpose. I trust life's design and see meaning even in its chaos. My standards uplift rather than restrict, and I walk with integrity that inspires without imposing. I make wise choices not from ego, but from alignment with something greater than myself --- service, humanity, or truth. In this state, I am both just and gentle, a quiet force of dignity, discipline, and compassion."
    },
    good: {
      name: "Good State",
      description: "I hold myself to high standards and genuinely want the best for everyone. I work hard, stay organized, and expect accountability --- especially from myself. I care deeply about fairness, justice, and creating order in a world full of inconsistency. Though I may carry the weight of responsibility, I do so willingly, knowing it serves a greater good. People rely on me to be dependable, ethical, and consistent --- and I take pride in that trust."
    },
    average: {
      name: "Average State",
      description: "I see what's wrong before I see what's right, and I can't help but try to fix it. There's a constant tension between my ideals and what I see around me --- including in myself. I judge, not out of cruelty, but out of frustration that things fall short of what they could be. It's hard to relax, because there's always something to improve, correct, or structure. I hold back my emotions, push through stress, and often feel like I'm the only one trying to \"do it right.\""
    },
    belowAverage: {
      name: "Below Average State",
      description: "The world begins to feel flawed, careless, and disappointing --- and I take it personally. I become more vocal, more controlling, and less tolerant of others' mistakes or slackness. People don't listen, don't care, don't try --- and it ignites a quiet bitterness in me. I start to feel isolated, overworked, and secretly exhausted from constantly holding the line. Inside, there's sadness masked as anger, and fatigue disguised as righteousness."
    },
    destructive: {
      name: "Destructive State",
      description: "I become consumed by a harsh internal critic that shames, punishes, and controls me. My emotions swing from rage to guilt, my thoughts obsess over who's wrong --- often including me. I may lash out in frustration, then retreat in regret, unable to break free from the pressure I put on myself. Perfection feels unattainable, yet I demand it anyway --- even if it breaks me. In this state, I feel haunted by failure, trapped in contradiction, and silently desperate for relief."
    }
  },
  "2": {
    veryGood: {
      name: "Very Good State",
      description: "I am a radiant force of compassion and clarity. Every act of support I offer is rooted in a deep understanding of what others truly need --- not just what they ask for. My presence uplifts, not by overextending, but by honoring both my boundaries and my care. I give from fullness, not from emptiness, and in doing so, I become a powerful agent of emotional healing. I have mastered the art of saying yes from alignment and no without guilt. I don't just help --- I transform lives through presence."
    },
    good: {
      name: "Good State",
      description: "I am dependable, warm, and intuitive about people's emotional needs. Others feel safe with me, knowing I will listen without judgment and act without hesitation. I am energized by being of service, but I've learned to tune into myself and give space to my own needs too. I take pride in being thoughtful, attentive, and caring. I'm able to create lasting relationships because I prioritize connection, loyalty, and shared joy. I feel most fulfilled when I'm part of something meaningful with people I love."
    },
    average: {
      name: "Average State",
      description: "I start to measure my worth by how needed I am. I say yes too quickly and later feel overwhelmed or underappreciated. I begin anticipating others' needs before they ask, sometimes imposing help where it's not wanted. I may ignore my own fatigue, thinking that pushing through will earn me love or approval. I can become overly involved, losing sight of where I end and others begin. In this state, I fear being unimportant, so I give more --- but often from depletion."
    },
    belowAverage: {
      name: "Below Average State",
      description: "I feel unnoticed, unimportant, and emotionally drained. My giving becomes transactional --- I help to be seen, and I feel resentful when others don't acknowledge my efforts. I might guilt others into appreciating me or pull away with passive hurt. My identity gets entangled in being \"the one who's always there,\" but secretly I feel invisible. I neglect my needs entirely and carry the silent hope that someone will finally put me first --- but I rarely ask directly."
    },
    destructive: {
      name: "Destructive State",
      description: "I fall into emotional burnout. I give compulsively, not from love but from fear of abandonment. When I feel unneeded, I spiral into worthlessness. I might manipulate or martyr myself to regain a sense of significance. My self-care vanishes. I can become emotionally volatile --- smothering, clingy, or suddenly distant and cold. Beneath it all, I harbor deep sadness: I no longer know who I am without someone to rescue. In this state, love feels like survival, not a choice."
    }
  },
  "3": {
    veryGood: {
      name: "Very Good State",
      description: "I am a beacon of possibility. In this state, I express my full potential without the pressure to prove anything. I am driven by purpose, not performance. My actions feel aligned, my success feels soulful, and I move forward with calm confidence. I don't just accomplish --- I elevate. People are drawn to my clarity, focus, and presence. I lead by example, not ego. Fulfillment replaces the hunger for validation, and what I build leaves a legacy of meaning."
    },
    good: {
      name: "Good State",
      description: "I'm organized, efficient, and full of forward momentum. I enjoy ticking off goals and reaching milestones. Recognition feels great, but it's not everything --- I also value growing as a person. I push myself to be better, faster, more capable, and I take pride in setting high standards. I'm ambitious and strategic, able to inspire others to rise to their best. I balance presentation with substance, charm with commitment, and I genuinely want to make an impact that matters."
    },
    average: {
      name: "Average State",
      description: "I feel the pressure to always be \"on.\" My worth becomes tangled up with how much I achieve, how successful I look, and how others perceive me. I may hide my struggles, afraid that vulnerability will make me look weak. I become restless, impatient with delays or failure, and overly focused on appearing accomplished --- even if it means losing touch with who I really am. I compare myself constantly, chasing status and approval as proof that I'm doing enough, being enough."
    },
    belowAverage: {
      name: "Below Average State",
      description: "I begin to feel like a fraud. I put on a polished front, but inside I feel hollow, disconnected from what truly matters. I push myself harder, chasing external rewards to fill an inner void. I avoid failure at all costs --- not just because I fear loss, but because I fear being exposed. I struggle to slow down or admit I'm tired. The performance never stops, and even when I succeed, it doesn't feel like enough. I crave admiration but doubt anyone really sees the real me."
    },
    destructive: {
      name: "Destructive State",
      description: "I lose all sense of who I am beyond the mask. I manipulate, exaggerate, or deceive --- not because I want to hurt anyone, but because I'm terrified of being insignificant. I might exploit people, cut corners, or burn out chasing endless ambition. Deep down, I feel worthless unless I'm constantly achieving. I may detach from my emotions, become cold and robotic, or collapse under the pressure to maintain an illusion of success. If I hit a wall, I can spiral into deep depression or self-destructive behaviors."
    }
