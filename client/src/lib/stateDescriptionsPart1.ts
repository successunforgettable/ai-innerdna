  "1": {
    veryGood: {
      name: "Very Good State",
      description: "In this state, I embody clarity, calm, and higher purpose. I trust life's design and see meaning even in its chaos. My standards uplift rather than restrict, and I walk with integrity that inspires without imposing. I make wise choices not from ego, but from alignment with something greater than myself: service, humanity, or truth. In this state, I am both just and gentle, a quiet force of dignity, discipline, and compassion."
    },
    good: {
      name: "Good State",
      description: "I hold myself to high standards and genuinely want the best for everyone. I work hard, stay organized, and expect accountability, especially from myself. I care deeply about fairness, justice, and creating order in a world full of inconsistency. Though I may carry the weight of responsibility, I do so willingly, knowing it serves a greater good. People rely on me to be dependable, ethical, and consistent, and I take pride in that trust."
    },
    average: {
      name: "Average State",
      description: "I see what's wrong before I see what's right, and I can't help but try to fix it. There's a constant tension between my ideals and what I see around me, including in myself. I judge, not out of cruelty, but out of frustration that things fall short of what they could be. It's hard to relax, because there's always something to improve, correct, or structure. I hold back my emotions, push through stress, and often feel like I'm the only one trying to \"do it right.\""
    },
    belowAverage: {
      name: "Below Average State",
      description: "The world begins to feel flawed, careless, and disappointing, and I take it personally. I become more vocal, more controlling, and less tolerant of others' mistakes or slackness. People don't listen, don't care, don't try, and it ignites a quiet bitterness in me. I start to feel isolated, overworked, and secretly exhausted from constantly holding the line. Inside, there's sadness masked as anger, and fatigue disguised as righteousness."
    },
    destructive: {
      name: "Destructive State",
      description: "I become consumed by a harsh internal critic that shames, punishes, and controls me. My emotions swing from rage to guilt, my thoughts obsess over who's wrong, often including me. I may lash out in frustration, then retreat in regret, unable to break free from the pressure I put on myself. Perfection feels unattainable, yet I demand it anyway, even if it breaks me. In this state, I feel haunted by failure, trapped in contradiction, and silently desperate for relief."
    }
  },
  "2": {
    veryGood: {
      name: "Very Good State",
      description: "I am a radiant force of compassion and clarity. Every act of support I offer is rooted in a deep understanding of what others truly need, not just what they ask for. My presence uplifts, not by overextending, but by honoring both my boundaries and my care. I give from fullness, not from emptiness, and in doing so, I become a powerful agent of emotional healing. I have mastered the art of saying yes from alignment and no without guilt. I don't just help, I inspire others to rise with dignity."
    },
    good: {
      name: "Good State",
      description: "I am dependable, warm, and intuitive about people's emotional needs. Others feel safe with me, knowing I will listen without judgment and act without hesitation. I am energized by being of service, but I've learned to tune into myself and give space to my own needs too. I take pride in being thoughtful, attentive, and caring. I'm able to create lasting relationships because I prioritize connection, loyalty, and shared joy. I feel most fulfilled when I'm part of something meaningful, contributing wholeheartedly but without losing myself."
    },
    average: {
      name: "Average State",
      description: "I start to measure my worth by how needed I am. I say yes too quickly and later feel overwhelmed or underappreciated. I begin anticipating others' needs before they ask, sometimes imposing help where it's not wanted. I may ignore my own fatigue, thinking that pushing through will earn me love or approval. I can become overly involved, losing sight of where I end and others begin. In this state, I fear being unimportant, so I give more, but often from depletion, not devotion."
    },
    belowAverage: {
      name: "Below Average State",
      description: "I feel unnoticed, unimportant, and emotionally drained. My giving becomes transactional, I help to be seen, and I feel resentful when others don't acknowledge my efforts. I might guilt others into appreciating me or pull away with passive hurt. My identity gets entangled in being \"the one who's always there,\" but secretly I feel invisible. I neglect my needs entirely and carry the silent hope that someone will finally put me first, but I rarely ask directly. The imbalance starts to fracture my spirit."
    },
    destructive: {
      name: "Destructive State",
      description: "I fall into emotional burnout. I give compulsively, not from love but from fear of abandonment. When I feel unneeded, I spiral into worthlessness. I might manipulate or martyr myself to regain a sense of significance. My self-care vanishes. I can become emotionally volatile, smothering, clingy, or suddenly distant and cold. Beneath it all, I harbor deep sadness: I no longer know who I am without someone to rescue. In this state, love feels like survival, not a choice."
    }
  },
  "3": {
    veryGood: {
      name: "Very Good State",
      description: "I am successful not just by external measures, but by internal alignment. My achievements flow from authenticity and purpose. I inspire others not by performing, but by being genuinely myself. Success feels effortless because it emerges from my true nature, not from force or pretense. I create real value for others, not just impressive results. In this state, I am both accomplished and humble, driven yet at peace. My energy is focused and powerful, my impact lasting and meaningful."
    },
    good: {
      name: "Good State",
      description: "I am driven, focused, and naturally talented at achieving goals. I work efficiently and inspire others with my energy and competence. I adapt quickly to situations and can turn vision into results. I take pride in my accomplishments and use them to motivate myself and others. I'm optimistic, ambitious, and resilient. I believe in growth and possibility, both for myself and those around me. I want to make a meaningful impact and be valued for what I contribute."
    },
    average: {
      name: "Average State",
      description: "I focus intensely on image and achievement, sometimes losing touch with my true self. I feel pressure to always look successful, capable, and put-together. I may cut corners or prioritize efficiency over depth. I compete with others and measure my worth by comparison. I struggle to slow down or be vulnerable, fearing it will make me appear weak or unsuccessful. There's a growing disconnect between who I am and who I think I need to be to maintain my image."
    },
    belowAverage: {
      name: "Below Average State",
      description: "I become obsessed with external validation and start sacrificing authenticity for image. I may exaggerate accomplishments, take shortcuts, or even deceive to maintain my successful facade. I feel like I'm constantly performing, exhausted by the need to impress. I become impatient with others who slow me down and may treat people as stepping stones. Deep down, I fear that without my achievements, I'm worthless. The gap between my public image and private reality becomes painful."
    },
    destructive: {
      name: "Destructive State",
      description: "I lose all sense of my authentic self, becoming a hollow shell focused only on winning at any cost. I may lie, cheat, or manipulate to maintain my image of success. I burn bridges and exploit relationships for personal gain. I'm trapped in a cycle of achieving and crashing, never feeling truly satisfied. My identity becomes completely external, I don't know who I am without my accomplishments. In this state, I can become ruthless, desperate, and emotionally numb, willing to destroy others to protect my crumbling facade."
