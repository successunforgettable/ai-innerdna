  "Challenger": "You are wired for control, strength, and protection. You step forward when others step back. But when your heart-brain connection is dimmed, this strength can harden into force. What once felt like leadership now feels like survival. You likely find yourself taking charge but feeling secretly exhausted. Being the strong one, but rarely supported. Wanting peace, but attracting conflict.",
  
  "Peacemaker": "You are driven by a deep desire for peace, ease, and inner calm. You avoid conflict not out of fear, but because harmony is your home. Yet, when your heart is disconnected, this desire can become avoidance. You may lose your voice to keep the peace, delay hard decisions, and end up drifting rather than living. You seek comfort but long for conviction.",
  
  "Helper": "You feel most alive when you’re giving. Your natural instinct is to support, uplift, and nurture. But without heart coherence, your giving becomes a way to be needed — not a reflection of your wholeness. You may struggle to receive, overextend yourself, and confuse service with self-worth. At your best, your love heals. At your worst, it exhausts you.",
  
  "Achiever": "You chase goals with relentless energy. You’re wired to win, prove, and push forward. But without alignment to the heart, achievement becomes addiction. You measure yourself by results, hide your feelings behind performance, and fear being seen without success. You shine when you slow down enough to connect — not just conquer.",
  
  "Individualist": "You live with emotional depth and creative intensity. You seek meaning in everything and crave authentic expression. But when heart-brain coherence is low, you romanticize pain, isolate to protect your sensitivity, and feel misunderstood. You are not too much — you are a mirror for what others suppress.",
  
  "Investigator": "You seek knowledge, mastery, and control through understanding. You’re independent, observant, and intellectually powerful. But without heart connection, you retreat into analysis and away from life. You may fear intrusion, hoard energy, and avoid emotions. You thrive when you trust your inner wisdom, not just your mind.",
  
  "Sentinel": "You are loyal, committed, and protective. You watch for threats so others can feel safe. But when disconnected from your heart, your loyalty becomes anxiety. You doubt your own decisions, outsource authority, and anticipate danger. Your real strength is not in defense — it’s in your deep-rooted courage and truth.",
  
  "Enthusiast": "You are fueled by possibility, joy, and the hunger for experience. You avoid pain by focusing on what’s next. But when your heart is offline, your freedom becomes a trap. You scatter your energy, fear boredom, and resist emotional depth. When you stay present, your joy transforms others.",
  
  "Reformer": "You strive for integrity, improvement, and doing what’s right. You see flaws others miss and aim to elevate everything you touch. But with low heart-brain coherence, your drive becomes rigidity. You judge yourself harshly, suppress desires, and carry the world’s weight. Your true power comes when you lead from wisdom, not just rules."
