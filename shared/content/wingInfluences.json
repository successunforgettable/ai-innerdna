  "Reformer_9": "As a Reformer 9, you bring calm, grounded judgment to every situation. You aim for what's right, but without becoming aggressive. You lead with consistency, not urgency. At times, you may hesitate to assert your views if peace is threatened, but your strength lies in steady alignment with values.",
  
  "Reformer_2": "As a Reformer 2, your desire to do right is infused with human warmth. You’re not just principled — you care. You may overextend yourself trying to help others live up to ideals, but your heart-driven discipline is powerful when you learn to receive as much as you give.",
  
  "Helper_1": "As a Helper 1, you express your care through order, structure, and doing things the 'right' way. You're motivated to serve, but also to improve. At your best, you're uplifting and ethical. Under pressure, you may become rigid in how you give, expecting others to meet your high standards.",
  
  "Helper_3": "As a Helper 3, you bring charm, charisma, and an instinct for success into your connections. You support others — and want to be recognized for it. When in balance, you’re inspiring and generous. When misaligned, your giving becomes a performance rather than a gift.",
  
  "Achiever_2": "As an Achiever 2, you pursue success by being deeply likable. You sense what others want from you and deliver it flawlessly. You lead with warmth and drive. But if disconnected from your heart, your value becomes entangled with being needed or appreciated.",
  
  "Achiever_4": "As an Achiever 4, your ambition is artistic, emotional, and identity-driven. You don’t just want to win — you want it to mean something. You bring creative depth to achievement. But this combination can cause mood swings or an internal pressure to always be extraordinary.",
  
  "Individualist_3": "As an Individualist 3, your desire for uniqueness is met with the energy to make it real. You bring vision to life. You don’t just feel deeply — you create impact. But when unbalanced, you may compare yourself excessively or lose authenticity trying to stand out.",
  
  "Individualist_5": "As an Individualist 5, your emotional depth is fused with private reflection. You withdraw not to avoid, but to understand. You express yourself after long internal processing. But you may isolate too long, delaying connection and grounding.",
  
  "Investigator_4": "As an Investigator 4, your insight is tinted with emotional depth. You see systems, but also symbolism. You may be introspective and intensely private, balancing clarity with longing. The risk is over-personalizing logic or spiraling into abstract emotional loops.",
  
  "Investigator_6": "As an Investigator 6, your thinking is practical, loyal, and defense-oriented. You scan for flaws before failure happens. This combination creates high-functioning problem solvers, but can also lead to suspicion or mental looping if you don’t trust yourself.",
  
  "Sentinel_5": "As a Sentinel 5, you stay one step ahead by analyzing everything. You’re strategic, observant, and detached when needed. This brings strong systems thinking. However, it can make emotional access difficult, even when connection is needed most.",
  
  "Sentinel_7": "As a Sentinel 7, you bring playful energy to responsibility. You lighten serious moments and seek options, not just plans. This makes you adaptable and adventurous — but under stress, it may lead to scattered focus or avoidance of tough emotions.",
  
  "Enthusiast_6": "As an Enthusiast 6, you mix spontaneity with loyalty. You bring excitement into the group, but still care about structure and safety. You’re social and committed. But fear can show up as overthinking disguised as fun, or conflict between freedom and duty.",
  
  "Enthusiast_8": "As an Enthusiast 8, you bring boldness to your curiosity. You don’t just want to explore — you want to take over the map. You’re charismatic and high-energy. When centered, you’re a leader who inspires movement. When off, you may bulldoze or burn out fast.",
  
  "Challenger_7": "As a Challenger 7, you’re forceful and future-focused. You challenge limits while chasing what’s next. This makes you an energetic disruptor — passionate and entertaining. But when ungrounded, you can avoid emotional depth or move too fast for others to keep up.",
  
  "Challenger_9": "As a Challenger 9, your power is steady and unshakable. You bring calm command — less fire, more presence. You don’t need to prove control; you become the grounding force. The risk is under-responding to pressure or ignoring necessary conflict to preserve peace.",
  
  "Peacemaker_8": "As a Peacemaker 8, you hold your ground with quiet strength. You want peace — but you won’t abandon yourself to get it. You’re firm, not forceful. This makes you dependable and calm. But when stressed, you may resist all pressure or shut down emotionally.",
  
  "Peacemaker_1": "As a Peacemaker 1, you bring order to your harmony. You avoid conflict — but not accountability. You strive to do what’s right without disturbing the peace. At your best, you’re a moral compass wrapped in calm. But at your worst, you suppress needs and judge quietly."
