Building Blocks - Fix Text Content Display
MICRO PROMPT: Fix Text Overflow in Building Blocks
File to modify: src/pages/BuildingBlocks.tsx or the building block component
ISSUE: Text content in Block A and Block B is overflowing the block boundaries and not wrapping properly.
EXACT FIX NEEDED:
Fix the building block text display with proper text wrapping and sizing:
tsx// Replace the building block content structure with:
<div className="building-block p-4 rounded-lg h-40 flex flex-col justify-center items-center text-center overflow-hidden">
  
  {/* Block Title */}
  <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">Block A</h3>
  
  {/* Block Content - Shortened and Properly Wrapped */}
  <p className="text-sm text-white/90 leading-tight line-clamp-4 px-2">
    I stay calm in the face of tension and seek to maintain internal balance. I want clarity and order, but without pressure or chaos.
  </p>
  
</div>

// For Block B:
<div className="building-block p-4 rounded-lg h-40 flex flex-col justify-center items-center text-center overflow-hidden">
  
  {/* Block Title */}
  <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">Block B</h3>
  
  {/* Block Content - Shortened and Properly Wrapped */}
  <p className="text-sm text-white/90 leading-tight line-clamp-4 px-2">
    I help others grow and improve by gently guiding them. I care about people's progress and feel responsible for their success.
  </p>
  
</div>
CSS Classes Needed:
css/* Add this CSS for text clamping if not available */
.line-clamp-4 {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 4;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
  overflow: hidden;
}
Requirements:

Set fixed height: h-40 (160px) for consistent block sizing
Use text-sm for smaller, readable text that fits
Add line-clamp-4 to limit text to 4 lines maximum
Use overflow-hidden to prevent text spillover
Center content with flex flex-col justify-center items-center
Add proper padding: p-4 for breathing room
Keep text color: text-white for titles, text-white/90 for content

This will make the text fit properly within the block boundaries and look aesthetically pleasing.
