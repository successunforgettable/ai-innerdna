TASK: Create a fully personalized transformation report generator that uses real assessment data to create unique content while maintaining the exact Challenger 9 visual template.

ASSESSMENT DATA INTEGRATION:
Your platform collects these specific metrics from users:
- personalityType: "1" (Reformer), "2" (Helper), "3" (Achiever), etc.
- wing: "9", "1", "2", etc. (from Building Blocks phase)
- colorStates: [{"state": "Order", "percentage": 70}, {"state": "Peace", "percentage": 30}]
- detailTokens: {"social": 4, "selfPreservation": 4, "sexual": 2}
- confidence: 88 (algorithm confidence percentage)

CRITICAL VISUAL REQUIREMENTS - ZERO DEVIATIONS:
âœ… Use 100% identical CSS, layout, and structure from Challenger 9 template
âœ… Same colors: --primary-purple: #6B46C1, --gold: #FFD700, --cyan: #00D4FF, --orange: #FF6B35
âœ… Same 11-stage hero's journey structure with identical stage numbers and layouts
âœ… Same animations, floating elements (âš¡ðŸ’«ðŸŒŸâœ¨), fonts (Inter/Playfair Display)
âœ… Same brain-heart SVG visualizations, card grids, progress bars, testimonials
âœ… Same CTA button styles, timeline structure, Wheel of Life 8-area grid
âœ… Same before/after sections, section dividers, hover effects

AI CONTENT GENERATION SYSTEM:

1. PARSE ASSESSMENT DATA:
   - Extract personalityType + wing combination (e.g., "Reformer 9")
   - Calculate dominant subtype from token distribution
   - Identify primary/secondary states from colorStates percentages
   - Use confidence level to adjust language intensity

2. PERSONALITY + WING COMBINATIONS (Examples):
   - Reformer 9: Perfectionism + Peace-seeking = "You strive for perfection but avoid conflict, creating inner tension between your high standards and desire for harmony"
   - Reformer 2: Perfectionism + People-pleasing = "You improve others while maintaining high standards, but burn out from helping everyone meet your expectations"
   - Helper 1: Service + Perfectionism = "You help others with precise care and high standards, but become resentful when your efforts aren't appreciated correctly"

3. STATE-BASED PERSONALIZATION:
   - 70% Order, 30% Peace: "You operate primarily from a need for structure and correctness, with an underlying desire for harmony that sometimes conflicts with your standards"
   - 60% Intense, 40% Focused: "Your passionate intensity drives your achievements, balanced by periods of laser-focused determination"
   - Different combinations = completely different life experience descriptions

4. SUBTYPE INTEGRATION:
   - Social dominant (4+ tokens): Focus on group standards, social correctness, community improvement
   - Self-Preservation dominant: Focus on personal routines, health standards, security through perfection
   - Sexual/One-to-One dominant: Focus on perfecting relationships, intensity in connections

5. FORBIDDEN TERMINOLOGY:
   Never use: "Enneagram", "Type 1/2/3", "wings", "arrows", "integration/disintegration"
   Always use: "Reformer 9", "Helper 2", "wing influence", "good/bad mood states"

6. DYNAMIC CONTENT EXAMPLES:

   For Reformer 9 (70% Order, 30% Peace, Social dominant):
   Stage 1: "You are a Reformer 9 - driven to improve the world while maintaining harmony. You see what's wrong everywhere and feel compelled to fix it, but your 9 influence makes you avoid the conflict that change often requires. You spend 70% of your time in an ordered, structured state, but that underlying 30% need for peace often sabotages your reforming efforts..."

   vs

   Reformer 2 (60% Intense, 40% Focused, Self-Preservation dominant):
   Stage 1: "You are a Reformer 2 - perfecting the world through service to others. Your intensity drives you to help people meet higher standards, but your self-preservation focus means you often burn out from giving too much. You operate with 60% passionate intensity, balanced by 40% focused determination, creating a unique pattern of helpful perfectionism..."

7. WHEEL OF LIFE PERCENTAGES:
   Use the exact percentages from Challenger 9 template (40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 45%, 20%) but adapt descriptions to match their specific personality + wing + state + subtype combination.

8. TESTIMONIALS MUST MATCH:
   - Use names/titles appropriate for their personality type
   - Reflect their exact state distribution in the testimonial content
   - Show transformation relevant to their specific metrics
   
   Example for Reformer 9 (Social dominant):
   "The Incredible You helped me stop trying to fix everyone else's problems and start creating the change I wanted to see. I learned to use my standards to build rather than just criticize." - Patricia Chen, Community Organizer & Reformer 9 Graduate

9. BRAIN-HEART SVG CONTENT:
   Stage 2: Adapt the "DISCONNECT DETECTED" message based on their pattern:
   - Reformer: "PERFECTIONISM PARALYSIS DETECTED"
   - Helper: "APPROVAL DEPENDENCY DETECTED" 
   - Achiever: "IMAGE-SUCCESS CONFLICT DETECTED"

10. TRANSFORMATION JOURNEY SPECIFICITY:
    Each stage must address their exact combination:
    - Stage 3 (Refusal): Address their specific subtype resistance
    - Stage 7 (Ordeal): Their unique breaking point based on personality + wing + states
    - Stage 8 (Reward): Their specific version of heart-brain coherence

API INTEGRATION WITH YOUR SYSTEM:
```javascript
// This should work with your existing endpoint structure
app.post('/api/generate-custom-report', async (req, res) => {
  const { assessmentData } = req.body;
  
  // Parse the assessment data
  const personalityType = assessmentData.primaryType; // "1", "2", "3", etc.
  const wing = assessmentData.wing; // "9", "1", "2", etc.
  const colorStates = assessmentData.colorStates; // [{"state": "Order", "percentage": 70}]
  const subtype = calculateDominantSubtype(assessmentData.detailTokens);
  
  // Generate AI content using the detailed prompt above
  const personalizedContent = await generateAIContent(assessmentData);
  
  // Inject into Challenger 9 template
  const reportHTML = await injectContentIntoTemplate(personalizedContent);
  
  res.send(reportHTML);
});
