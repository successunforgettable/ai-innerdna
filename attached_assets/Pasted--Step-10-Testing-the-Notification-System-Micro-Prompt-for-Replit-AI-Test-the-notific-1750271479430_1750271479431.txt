# **Step 10: Testing the Notification System**

## **Micro Prompt for Replit AI:**

Test the notification system to ensure all components are working correctly.

**TESTING CHECKLIST:**

**Test 1: Check Notification Bell**
1. Run your Replit app
2. Look for the bell icon in your header
3. The bell should show a red badge with "1" (because we have 1 notification in the JSON)
4. Click the bell - it should open the notification center

**Test 2: Check Notification Center**
1. Click the notification bell
2. A modal should appear with "Notifications" header
3. You should see one notification: "Welcome to Inner DNA"
4. Click the X button or outside the modal to close it

**Test 3: Check Login Notification**
1. The login notification should not appear yet (user is null)
2. We'll test this after adding proper user login

**DEBUGGING STEPS if something doesn't work:**

**If bell doesn't appear:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all import statements in App.jsx are correct
3. Ensure NotificationBell is added to your header component

**If clicking bell doesn't work:**
1. Check that NotificationCenter component is added to App.jsx
2. Verify the context provider wraps your entire app
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**If no notifications show:**
1. Verify notifications.json file exists in src/data/
2. Check browser Network tab - should see request to notifications.json
3. Open browser console and type: `fetch('/src/data/notifications.json').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)`

**Test the CSS:**
1. Bell should have hover effect (background changes)
2. Badge should be orange/amber color
3. Modal should have smooth animations
4. Modal should center on screen with dark overlay

## **Instructions:**
1. Run your Replit app
2. Go through each test above
3. Note any issues you encounter
4. Check browser console for any error messages
5. If everything works, the notification system is ready!

**Expected Result:** Bell icon appears with "1" badge, clicking opens modal with welcome notification.
