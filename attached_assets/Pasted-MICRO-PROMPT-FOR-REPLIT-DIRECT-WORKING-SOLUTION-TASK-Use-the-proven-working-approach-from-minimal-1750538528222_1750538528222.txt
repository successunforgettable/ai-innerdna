MICRO-PROMPT FOR REPLIT - DIRECT WORKING SOLUTION
TASK: Use the proven working approach from minimal test
RULE: Expand the successful minimal test approach that already worked
CONSTRAINT: Build on what we know works - avoid API timeout issues
Create working solution based on successful minimal test:
javascript// Create working-solution.js
const fs = require('fs');
const { calculateProgressPercentages } = require('./percentageCalculator');
const { injectContentIntoTemplate } = require('./templateInjector');

async function generateWorkingReport() {
