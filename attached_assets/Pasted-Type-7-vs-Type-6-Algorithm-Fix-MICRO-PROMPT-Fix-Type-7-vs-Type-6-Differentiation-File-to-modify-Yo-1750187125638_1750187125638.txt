Type 7 vs Type 6 Algorithm Fix
MICRO PROMPT: Fix Type 7 vs Type 6 Differentiation
File to modify: Your personality type calculation algorithm
ISSUE: HEAD_PURE_TYPE7 test returning Type 6 instead of Type 7. Both are Head center types, so the algorithm needs better differentiation.
EXACT FIX NEEDED:
The key difference between Type 6 and Type 7 is their response to fear and energy direction:

Type 6 (Sentinel): Fear-based + Compliant/Cooperative energy
Type 7 (Enthusiast): Fear-based + Assertive energy (escaping fear through action)

Code to fix:
javascript// In your personality type calculation function, find the section that handles
// Head center types (Types 5, 6, 7) and update the differentiation logic:

// When Head center is selected (selections[0] === 0):
if (selections[0] === 0) { // Head center
  
  // Base scoring for all head types
  typeScores.type5 += 1 * setWeights[0];
  typeScores.type6 += 1 * setWeights[0];
  typeScores.type7 += 1 * setWeights[0];
  
  // Differentiate based on fear motivation and energy direction
  if (selections[1] === 0) { // Fear motivation
    
    if (selections[2] === 2) { // Compliant/Cooperative energy = Type 6
      typeScores.type6 += 3 * setWeights[0];
      typeScores.type7 += 0.5 * setWeights[0];
      typeScores.type5 += 1 * setWeights[0];
      
    } else if (selections[2] === 1) { // Assertive energy = Type 7  
      typeScores.type7 += 3 * setWeights[0];
      typeScores.type6 += 0.5 * setWeights[0];
      typeScores.type5 += 1 * setWeights[0];
      
    } else if (selections[2] === 0) { // Withdrawn energy = Type 5
      typeScores.type5 += 3 * setWeights[0];
      typeScores.type6 += 1 * setWeights[0];
      typeScores.type7 += 1 * setWeights[0];
    }
  }
}

// Also strengthen the energy direction scoring in Set 3:
if (selections[2] === 1) { // Assertive energy
  // Type 7 uses assertive energy to escape fear/anxiety
  if (selections[0] === 0 && selections[1] === 0) { // Head + Fear + Assertive
    typeScores.type7 += 2 * setWeights[2];
    typeScores.type6 += 0.5 * setWeights[2];
  }
  
} else if (selections[2] === 2) { // Compliant/Cooperative energy  
  // Type 6 seeks security through cooperation and structure
  if (selections[0] === 0 && selections[1] === 0) { // Head + Fear + Compliant
    typeScores.type6 += 2 * setWeights[2];
    typeScores.type7 += 0.5 * setWeights[2];
  }
}

// Additional differentiation in conflict style (Set 7):
if (selections[6] === 2) { // Direct conflict style
  // Type 7 more likely to be direct to avoid being trapped
  typeScores.type7 += 1.5 * setWeights[6];
  typeScores.type6 += 0.5 * setWeights[6];
  
} else if (selections[6] === 1) { // Accommodating conflict style
  // Type 6 more likely to accommodate for security
  typeScores.type6 += 1.5 * setWeights[6];
  typeScores.type7 += 0.5 * setWeights[6];
}
Key Differentiation Points:

Energy Direction: Type 7 = Assertive, Type 6 = Compliant
Fear Response: Type 7 escapes through action, Type 6 seeks security through structure
Conflict Style: Type 7 more direct, Type 6 more accommodating
Motivation: Type 7 avoids limitations, Type 6 seeks support/guidance

Requirements:

Strengthen Type 7 scoring when Head + Fear + Assertive pattern appears
Strengthen Type 6 scoring when Head + Fear + Compliant pattern appears
Ensure the algorithm clearly differentiates these similar types
